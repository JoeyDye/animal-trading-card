# Animal Trading Card

This is an animal trading card I created for the Udacity Front-End Developoment Nano Degree Program. The goal of the project was use HTML and CSS to create a trading card of my favorite animal.

## Project Details

This project was created using basic HTML and CSS. The requirements of the project included

* italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
* bolded labels for the animal's list items
* no dots for the animal's list items
* border around the animal's name, image, and information
* border around the animal's information
* spacing between the animal's name, image, and information

In addition to these elements, I also added a few custom styles, such as a grey background gradient as well as a CSS filter to enhance the contrast of the image.
