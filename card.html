			<p class="bio__description">It is said that white tigers have the will of a tiger, the speed of a cheetah, and the heart of a lion. They are adapted with white bodies and gray stripes, helping them hide in long grass or snow. Their habitat consists of food, water and trees. Since white tigers are close to extinction, they mostly live in zoos.</p>
